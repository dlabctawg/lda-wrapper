### CollabEdit

*Sadly our collabedit pages are gone! We are looking for a replacement, possibly [CodeBunk](www.codebunk.com)...*

>The CollabEdit page for this source file is a space for live coding with a group. What you see here will update on others' screens. View the version history here: http://collabedit.com/w7m72/history. Please make sure work done in CollabEdit contributes to the Git repo by copying it to your fork and submitting it as a pull request. The Run page provides an example script to run the function with arguments using a file structure like the one in the Git repository.
