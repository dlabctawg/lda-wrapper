Estimation methods waiting to be interpreted.

Topic models is an interpretation waiting to be estimated.

Anchor words big assumption, we should try anchor words with Jake's frequency counting

No document topic distributions

Anchor based models as initialization

#t-SNE projection

multidimensional scaling, project 2d/3d space of words, get better anchor words

LSI, topic models, word embeddings, brown clusters?
